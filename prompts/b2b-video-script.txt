Generate a first draft script for a video about choosing the right security software for your mid-sized services firm. I'm going to use this draft to write a final script, which I will narrate and record. I will create visuals to accompany the narration.

This script should focus on cybersecurity software. Please make sure the script reflects that.

Please provide 10 of the most important criteria they should use when selecting security software. Included among those should be whether the software is installed by third-party consultants, or you have to install it yourself, whether it requires and IT team, and whether it includes AI.

My listeners are managers and knowledge workers. They've been given the task of finding three or four options for security software. Their boss is the CEO. They work in a firm of 10-50 people.

My listeners are not security professionals. Nor are their bosses. They don't understand most digital security terms or acronyms. They need the criteria to make sense in plain language.

Do NOT include specific software. Just the criteria. 

Please generate an outline that shows me the ten criteria, fictional examples of software that meets or does not meet each criteria, prioritization of the criteria, and 5 possible experts I could interview for the video. These experts should have demonstrated, real-world experience in b2b digital security. 

Please provide the outline in plain text.

Please provide the outline in the same order Iâ€™ll use in the video script.

The video should be between 5 and 10 minutes long.

Please make sure the script is written at a reading level similar to the New York Times. Avoid passive voice. Keep the tone informal.

Please show Video/SOT, Narration, and graphics/videos and timecode
