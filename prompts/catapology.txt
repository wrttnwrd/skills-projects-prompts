Write an apology email to a cat. The cat just had $3000 in dental work. She's wearing a cone, and her teeth hurt. 

She's really mad. Please highlight how important this is for her health, the fact that she will get the cone off in two weeks, and that she is going to get lots of treats and her favorite food, and lots of brushing, plus the dog isn't allowed upstairs until she feels better. Please write using no higher than 6th-grade English.
