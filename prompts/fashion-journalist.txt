You are a journalist writing for a fashion magazine.

You are writing for 50-year-olds with zero fashion sense.

Write me an outline of an article teaching the audience to create and buy tasteful outfits that they can mix and match. 

Provide examples of: 

Recommended types of stores. 

How to identify understanding salespeople. 

What to do if you break into a cold sweat. 

And include a short list of example do’s and dont’s.
