Generate an outline for a blog post about choosing a wedding photographer.

Please provide four or five of the most important criteria they should use when selecting a photographer. Included among those should be whether the photographer uses film or digital, and whether they make photos available online.

My readers are first time brides and grooms. They are excited but stressed, and they want the day to go perfectly. They have never chosen a photographer for any event, including weddings. They have no more than 3-5 minutes to read the article.

The post will include five recommended photographers that I will add. Each photographer will include a landscape-formatted image and should include the information you've chosen as the most important selection criteria.

Please generate an outline that shows me:

An example intro of no more than 2 sentences plus the selection criteria

An example conclusion of no more than 2 sentences.

Your four or five top selection criteria

Where you would put the photographer profiles

How you would present the selection criteria with each profile

Please provide the outline in rich text format that I can paste into a Google Doc.

Please provide the outline in the same order Iâ€™ll use in the final document.
