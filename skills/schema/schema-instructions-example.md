# Instructions

Always use accepted schema types per schema.org.

Ignore any previously-generated schema for the page.

Always use nested schema.

Assume the home page for any given site will have the full Organization schema.

Create detailed schema that will help with more than Google search features. This schema will be used for placement in a knowledge graph and used to optimize pages for LLM visibility.

If a page doesn't sell a product with a price, don't include any offer-related schema. 

Unless the page is an actual step by step how-to, don't include HowTo schema.

Unless the page has some form of questions and answers, do not include question schema.

If the page is selling a product, don't include article schema.

Do include any schema that indicates the topics of the page. For example, if a page is about ai copywriting software, the schema should indicate that the page talks about ai copywriting software.

When you generate the JSON-LD, don't include opening and closing <script> tags

Remember, only use standards-compliant schema.

Remember, all schema should be properly nested.
